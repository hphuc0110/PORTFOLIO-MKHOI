            Originality means being difference, and creating difference is a
            rough journey.

            Being Original means willing to try.
            <br />
            Every choice, every story <br />
            every challenge, every success

            Phúc Long's passion from the start has always been to create
            original flavors. We handpick, dry, fry, and grind every tea leaf
            with care - a technique that brings out the most flavor, just as
            strong as our passion.
          </div>
          <div>
            To thrive as tea connoisseur, we constantly explore and unveil new
            recipes.
            <br />
            We open up the world of strong taste, one sip at a time. With every
            creation, we’re closer to mastery.
          </div>
          <div>
            Let the strong flavour inspire you to create your own world, a world
            of originality.
